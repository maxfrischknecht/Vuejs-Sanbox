# 06 Vue CLI

The main difference between "normal" Vue and the Vue CLI is, that the normal version has a build in compiler and Vue compiles the files right away inside the browser. With the CLI this compiler is missing and we need to pre-compile the files before we ship them. This way we have super fast and lightweight files to ship after compiling.
